        <p class="about_text">I am a 24 year old aspiring web developer. I have an interest in coding because I sincerely did not understand how it worked at all, although that is changing now.  I'm particularly interested in web development because I've grown up in the age where the internet really took off, and with no signs of slowing down, I'm sure web developers are in pretty high demand, which helps because I'm looking to change careers.</p>
        <p class="about_text">Other than being interested in learning how to code, I'm in to alot of other things.  I love to be active, so I spend most of my free time either at the YMCA or my local yoga studio.  I've been playing the guitar for roughly half my life now, so when I get the chance I love to play, either alone or with friends.  Other than that I'm pretty typical... I like beer and I like to hang out with my friends.</p>
